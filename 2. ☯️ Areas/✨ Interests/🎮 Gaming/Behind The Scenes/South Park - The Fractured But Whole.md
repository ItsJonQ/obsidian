### [[Know The Medium]]

**1:28**
[[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]] are both gamers. So they deeply understand the mechanics and the medium. They worked closely with the team at [[Ubisoft]] to ensure they nail the process perfectly.

### [[User Feedback]]

**2:29**
[[Trey Parker]] mentioned how useful it was to watch [[PewDiePie]] play and provide feedback for their previous game, [[South Park - The Stick of Truth]].

> ...and it was the best material I could have, because it was like,
> I was watching an audience member play it, and what they were thinking about it.
> ...and going "Oh, this part is lame" (PewDiePie)
> ...okay this part's lame (Trey)
> It was great to have that as a resource.
>
> — [[Trey Parker]]

This was a great example of using to help shape [[Design]].

### [[Move Intentionally Fast]]

**3:23**
(The video shows clips of how the game was designed and developed.)

The team at Ubisoft had to adjust their design and development process to adapt to South Park's famous [[South Park - 6 Days to Air]] turn-around time.

> One of the challenges we knew we'd face is that [[Trey Parker]] would like to try stuff and change stuff. And we knew we'd have to be as fast as the show. Or at least, try to get somewhere close.

### [[Respecting The Source Material]]

**4:17**
Various Ubisoft designers mention that there's a specific style to [[South Park]], and it isn't something that can be easily replicated without studying the source material.

> It is much more complex than some of the high graphic games that I've worked on. Simply because it's so hand drawn and that it's a unique style. There's a lot of [[Attention to Detail]] in this show.
>
> — [[Lisette Titre-Montgomery]] (Art Manager, [[Ubisoft]])

### Combat, Biggest [[Technical Challenge]]

**4:42**
Combat, one of the core mechanics to the game, if not **the** core mechanic to the game, was the hardest feature to develop. They wanted a continue the turn-based style. This worked well for comedic effects and (J)RPG style of the game. Most importantly, it emphasized the idea of the kids "playing a game within a game" ([[Matt Stone]]).

**5:23**
One (simple) interaction they added to play upon the ridiculousness of South Park was to randomly interrupt combat with an incoming car. This breaks the flow of combat, but reinforces the idea that these are just kids playing a game. And you, the player, are part of this game.

> You want it to be complex enough to be fun and challenging and to have strategies. But you want it to be simple enough that it looks like South Park, and that it's still [[Fun]].
