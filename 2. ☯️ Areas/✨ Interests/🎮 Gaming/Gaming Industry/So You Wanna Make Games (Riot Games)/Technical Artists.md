People who can do both art and programming within the [[Gaming Industry]] are known as [[Technical Artists]], or Tech Artists.

> This is Extremely important to being a Tech Artist.
> It's understanding how games are made, and what you need to do.

## [[Bridge The Gap]]

**0:52**
Tech artists are individuals who can do both art and programming. Some of the things they do include:

- Building tools for artists.
- Streamline the game creation pipeline.
- Create game exporters.
- Improve implementation workflows.
- Rigging characters for [[Animation]].
- File structure, version control support, [[Automation]]
- Animate, make VFX, builder [[User Interfaces]], shaders, lighting, etc...

Simply put...

> Tech artists streamline how art is made and put into the game.

## [[Rigging]]

**1:46**
One of the major specializations is character rigging. Models are provided by [[Character Artists]]. These models are like sculptures. It is up to Tech Artists to provide the skeleton to the model transforming the sculpture-like model into more of a puppet. This allows for the model to move and to animate.

### Weight Painting

**2:27**
The model's movement is influences by it's attachment to the skeleton. These values (referred to as "weight" or "influence") can be adjusted to move more or less parts of the model.

A process of (quickly) adjusting these values is called "weight painting", which involves the Tech Artist painting the surface of the model in a specialized mode.

### Master of Puppets

**3:03**
To make the model easier for [[Animators]] to work with, the bones are grouped into a series of controls. This allows for a more intuitive puppet-like manipulation, rather than having to move individual bones.

Tech Artists have to consider how moving one part of the model my affect another.

## [[Custom Tools]]

**3:30**
Tech Artists have to create custom tools for custom workflows for their colleagues. However, they must first understand the needs of their colleagues. This begins with the fundamental and all-important question:

> What are you trying to do?

Even though an artist means well, they may not be as informed as a Tech Artist.

## [[Implementation]]

**4:33**
Tech Artists have to understand the workflows of artists. They create custom implementations (often automations) to invisibly streamline the artists workflows.

## [[Pipeline]]

**5:24**
Tech Artists help manage the [[Game Development Pipeline]] by creating clear channels, processes, and tools that help team members work cross functionality.

[[Version Control]] is critical to the pipeline. Tech Artists build tools to make interacting with version control easier for artists. Tools may also handle [[File Naming]], and perform mass file naming if needed.

## [[Shaders]]

**7:47**
Some Tech Artists specialize in [[Shaders]]. They work with parameters to allow for workflows like painting various textures like rocks and grass very quickly on terrain.

> Tech Artists **might** write the shader code, or work with an Engineer to figure out what the shaders need to do to support the art.

Tech Artists influence the look of the art, and **teach** the artists how to use the shader parameters.

## [[Simulation]]

**9:21**

Using math to simulate the behaviours of materials and physics, like water, lava, and cereal.

## Advice

**10:07**

- Taking [[Critical Feedback]] from places that have turned you down.
- Get ready to learn new things.
- Understanding the principles of something to translate it into something else.
- Embrace the hybrid of art and programming and flex those creative muscles in cool and visible ways.
- One of the most challenging parts is having to [[Context Switching|context switch]] constantly throughout the day.
- Be quick on your feet, so you can constantly pivot what you're doing to help someone else.
- Download something. Try it. Learn it.
  - Specifically, a lower-level thing like a game engine.
  - Teach you the ins and outs of making a game
  - Allows you to be able to be injected where you need to.
- Recognize that you're going to fail and that it's not going to be easy.
