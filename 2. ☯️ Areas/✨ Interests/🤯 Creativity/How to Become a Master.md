# How to Become a Master

[[Kim Jung Gi]], Dec 10, 2018

Kim Jung Gi is a well known artist that does amazingly accurate drawings from memory - without any construction lines. Everyone is amazed by his memory.

This interview is going to try to figure out why Kim Jung Gi is so good. What makes him one of the best draftsman ([[Drafter]]) in the world.

## Events

KJG travels half the year and does live drawing events frequently. The other half, he spends with his family. He says he tries not too draw too much when he's home.

He's always drawing.

Everyone is mesmerized by his performance.
Everyone wants to figure out how they can get this good.

> How can I get such a giant visual library in my brain?
> Tell us the secret Kim Jung Gi!

**KJG**

- I am able to remember and recall images for a much longer period of time than most people. But, I also drew so much. I probably drew way more than people think I have.

We can't overlook how much of his talent was developed.

## Childhood

He's always liked drawing from a young age. He was already quite advanced for his age, drawing 3D objects when his kindergarten peers were drawing 2D objects. Praise and affirmation encouraged him to pursue the arts even more.

> I started drawing things that interested me.
> My school life could be summarized in two activities:
> Kicking a ball around, and drawing.
>
> — Kim Jung Gi

He doesn't seem like the type of guy that would follow someone else's dreams.
He does what he wants. He says what he wants. He draws what he wants.

Out of all of his siblings (who live "ordinary lives"), he thinks he's the happiest.

## Political Correctness

> I'm not a fan. I do try to be presentable, but I'm horrible at packaging myself up as something I'm not.
>
> — Kim Jung Gi

Genitalia was a subject that interested him when he was younger.
However, he found that he had to limit himself, effectively censoring himself, as he became more famous.

He had his last hoorah in 2015 with the release of "Omphalos", a collection of the naughtiest of this naughty works.

> I've had people ask me why I draw genitalia.
> Well, I draw them because they're there.
>
> I still have a lot of naughty thoughts inside of me of me.
> I just have more people around me to keep me under control.
>
> I use to draw whatever I wanted back when I weasn't famous, almost like thought vomiting. But, since I now have a reputation to keep, I have limitations.
>
> **That makes me a little sad**.
>
> — Kim Jung Gi

He doesn't hide his drawings from his kids. Sometimes it has erotic drawings in it.

> My son just says, "Dad, you're a pervert".
>
> — Kim Jung Gi

## Military

He heard that high ranking people in the military would ask artists to do all sorts of drawings, for example: their families, their girlfriends, etc... So, he pretended to draw badly on purpose.

> I really dislike these types of commission work.
> I don't even draw my own family, so why should I draw someone else's.
>
> — Kim Jung Gi

The first year was so intense that he couldn't draw at all until he became a corporal.

> I would draw in my head a lot.
>
> For example, when I was inside a military aircraft, waiting to parachute down, I would observe the internal structure of the aircraft and draw it in my mind.
>
> Of course, it was a little scary, but my interests overrode any fear.
>
> — Kim Jung Gi

## Observation

There are two major things that he does that makes him, him.
He's always observing.
He's always focused on how things look, and saving that in his [[Visual Library]].

> I would keenly observe the gears and the guns, and try to touch and feel them if I could.
>
> — Kim Jung Gi

In response to the question, "What traits do you have that make you a great artist?"

> Observation skill.
>
> — Kim Jung Gi

## Visual Library

When you learn how to draw a human, when you understand the mechanics of a human body, it's easier to draw animals. After you learn how to draw a lion, drawing a tiger becomes easier.

==It's just a matter of studying them enough to figure out the differences.==

> Once you start to understand the content, you can manipulate them, or you can change them however you want. Or even change merge them with mechanical elements, or human to an animal.
>
> It's an application.
>
> And that's how you can be more free when you draw. To deliver your ideas.
>
> — Kim Jung Gi

When he's drawing, he's not drawing the exact object (e.g. helmet and goggles) he saw from places like a museum. But rather, he adjusts them and combines them with other like objects he's seen in his life.

> How I work is not to deliver 1:1 accurate photo image to you guys.
> It's about using visual communication to make you believe what you see is correct.
>
> — Kim Jung Gi

He reinforces things in his visual library by drawing them. And drawing a lot.

## Drawing is Breathing

> I enjoy the process more.
> Nowadays, I draw like it's a habit.
> So it's as natural for me as breathing.
>
> — Kim Jung Gi

When he's not drawing for the show. He's in the back, he's drawing into the books that people bought.

It really is like breathing for him.

When he's traveling, he's always drawing to discourage people from asking him too many questions.

> See, I still find drawing fun.
> I hope I don't lose that sense of joy for a long time.
>
> — Kim Jung Gi

Drawing is breathing.
As long as he's breathing, he's happy.
He's happy because he gets to do what he wants, all day.

---

This is Kim Jung Gi.
He draws a lot.
Everyone should be amazed by how much he draws.

I should draw more.
