# The Individual Over Any Established System

[[Bruce Lee]], Nov 9, 2016

#todo Read this

> Man, the living creature, the creating individual, is always more important than any established style or system.

> Why do you as an individual depend on thousands of years of propaganda? Ideals, principles, the 'what should be' leads to hypocrisy.

> Man is constantly growing, and when he is bound by a set pattern of ideas or 'Way' of doing things, thatâ€™s when he stops growing.

> In solitude you are least alone. Make good use of it.
