# I Do Not Believe in Styles Anymore

[[Bruce Lee]], 1971 ([[Bruce Lee - Pierre Burton Show Interview]])

I do not believe in styles anymore.

I do not believe that there's a Chinese way of fighting, or a Japanese way of fighting, or whatever way of fighting. Unless human beings have 3 arms and 4 legs, we will have a different form of fighting. But, basically we have only 2 hands and 2 feet.

So styles tend to not only separate man.
They have their own doctrines and their doctrines became the gospel truth - that you cannot change.

If you do not have styles, if you just say,

"Here I am, as a human being.
How can I express myself?
Totally and completely?"

That way, you won't create a style.
==Because style is a crystallization.==
==That way, it's a process of continuing growth.==
