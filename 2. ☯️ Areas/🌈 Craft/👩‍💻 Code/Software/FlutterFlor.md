**Build Flutter Apps Effortlessly**
Building mobile applications has never been easier.

## Build

`Build Apps Visually.`

Drag and drop components, and turn designs into real application screens in minutes instead of hours. Take advantage of the various widgets and their properties to build elaborate and beautiful apps.

## Connect Screens

Control how a user navigates through the app, pass parameters with navigation to enable real-world use cases, and preview the app right in your browser.

## Connect to Firebase

`Connect Your Designs to Firebase`

Easily implement dynamic data in your designs, quickly hook up Firebase and then select where those calls are made within your design.

## Export Code

`Preview & Export Code`

View the generated code in your browser, copy and paste it to your editor, download and run in your emulator, or connect it with GitHub in order to sync with your repository!
