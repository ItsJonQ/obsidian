# Design Systems

## Philosophy

Design Systems are the totality of people create things together. [[Component Libraries|Components]], color palettes, [[Design Tokens]], [[Typography]] scales, etc... are all atomic pieces of the system.

==Design Systems empower **People** by cultivating **Processes** through the creation and refinement of **Product**==.
