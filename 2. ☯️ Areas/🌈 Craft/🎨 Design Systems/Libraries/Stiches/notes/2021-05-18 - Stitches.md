## $Variable

### Theme Binding

👍👍

These variables are defined in the **initial** theme during the `createCSS()` process, where `styled` is created and pre-bound to these theme values.

### Getter

👍👍👍👍👍

Stitches allows for variable (theme property) access within the `style` `object` by using the `$variableName` convention.

A **huge** benefit of this `styled` + theme generation and pre-binding is their [[TypeScript]] support. For example, typing in `$` when styling a property will present the user with an auto-complete in VS Code. On top of that, certain theme values can be customized for certain properties. For example, target typography specific values to typography based styles.

### Computed value ergonomics

👎

A limitation of the `$variableName` convention is that in order to adjust the the variable value (in any way), you **must** pass it through a custom utility function.

## Unintuitive Abstractions via Utils

👎👎

Stitches allows you to add custom `utils` functions, which work similar to [[Sass]] functions (or mixins). Even a value, they can transform/compute the value to something else.

https://stitches.dev/docs/utils

For example, you could have a `br` utility that generated a `border-radius`.

Every utility (`key`) would be accessible to the `style` `object` in Stitches' `styled()` component.

```jsx
const Box = styled('div', {
	size: '200px',
	linearGradient: '19deg, #21D4FD 0%, #B721FF 100%',
	br: '$round', // Here
})
```

I feel like this makes it harder, as it mixes custom keys with standard `style` properties. It forces the user to have to learn and remember specific keys to access (probably) common utilities.

This "**CSS shorthand props**" pattern can also be found in other libraries like [Styled Systems](https://styled-system.com/getting-started#margin--padding) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/style-props). The pattern being shorthand props to style names, `mr` for `marginRight`.

Stitches takes it further be enabling and encouraging non-standard shorthands and everything else through their `utils` API.

## Changing Themes

### Native CSS Variables

👍👍

Stitches uses [[CSS Variables]] as a core part of it's [[Theming System]]. They heavily leverage apply custom theming, especially to scoped UI sections.

https://stitches.dev/docs/theming#add-a-new-theme

A custom theme can be created with the `theme` `function` provided by the initial `createCSS`.

```jsx
export const darkTheme = theme('dark-theme', {...});

<div className={darkTheme}>
  <Box>Content nested in dark theme.</Box>
</div>
```

The theme can then be applied to a regular `<div />` via a `className`. Stitches generated `styled()` component theme values will connect to these scoped theme values through the native [[CSS Variables]] feature.

### Portal(less)

👎

A downside to using only [[CSS Variables]] is that portal'ed components cannot absorb the custom properties because they will be rendered in a different part of the (actual) DOM tree.

This can be worked around by creating custom `ThemeContext` providers and hooks to communicate through [[React Context]] within a custom `Portal` component to ensure theming works correctly.

## Built-in Variants

👍👍

https://stitches.dev/docs/variants

Variants are a first-class API within Stitches. The `style` `objects` within each variant follow the same conventions as the main `style` `object`. These variants can be activated by Component props, specified by their key/value relationships under the `variant` `object`.

```jsx
const Button = styled('button', {
	// base styles

	variants: {
		color: {
			violet: {
				backgroundColor: 'blueviolet',
				color: 'white',
				'&:hover': {
					backgroundColor: 'darkviolet',
				},
			},
			gray: {
				backgroundColor: 'gainsboro',
				'&:hover': {
					backgroundColor: 'lightgray',
				},
			},
		},
	},
})

;() => <Button color="violet">Button</Button>
```

In the above example, `color="violet"` maps to `variants.color.violet`.
