![My Obsidian Vault](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ItsJonQ/obsidian/main/3.%20%F0%9F%93%A6%20Resources/Attachments/My%20Obsidian%20Vault.png)

This repository mirrors my actual main Obsidian Vault.
All personal and confidential information has been removed and replaced with fake content.

The purpose of this Vault is to showcase how I organize my Obsidian system, which includes:

- Folder/file structure
- Templates
- Keyboard Bindings
- Preferences
- Plugins
- Themes

Feel free to ~~steal~~ borrow any ideas and resources you'd like!

Documentation coming soon.
